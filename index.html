							<h2>Career</h2>
							<p>I've been a full-time student my entire life, so my only work experiences are side-jobs that have little to do with development. Nonetheless, I've been studying programming and practicing it as a hobby since a very young age, so I'll be sharing some of my experiences.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>First Game</h3>
									<p>My first ever attempt at programming was all the way back in middle school. I learned on my own throughout various Telegram groups how to make something in PHP, and I used that knowledge to make a Cookie Clicker-like Telegram Bot that I shared with a group of friends.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-school"></span>
									<h3>High School Experiences</h3>
									<p>Throughout all of my 5 years of High School I had 2 hours of Programming Classes a week. We started with some basic HTML, worked our way up to learning low-level C++ and were also taught some MySQL. I ended up graduating with perfect grades in Programming, which is what pushed me towards pursuing this career.</p>
								</section>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>University</h3>
									<p>After high school was over I decided to get into University for Computer Science, and I'm currently approaching the end of my second year here. Throughout my first year we were taught Java, and using only the cmd as input and output, I started making some basic games like Russian Roulette, Connect Four, Hangman, Chess etc.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Unity</h3>
									<p>Eventually I stumbled upon Unity, half a year ago, and started working on my very first game, Tainted Lands, a Top-Down Action Adventure Metroidvania.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Game Jams</h3>
									<p>With more familiarity with Unity and Game Development, I seeked towards participating in short game jams to get quick progress and results and to hone my skills as much as possible. I ended up making an entirely new team with other very competent developers I met in the jams' respective Discords, and so far we've worked on three successful Game Jam games, with even more to come.</p>

									<h3>Future</h3>
									<p>I am currently working on my Unreal Engine skills, trying to learn how to work with 3D elements and work towards making a multiplayer-compatible game. One of my close friends is teaching me directly so I can join his team and help them create games for Mobile platforms.</p>
