							</p>
							<p>As my first ever Game Development endeavor it was a very new experience for me. I started from scratch using Unity's own Tutorials, Documentations and tons and tons of YouTube videos. The process lasted about a month full of learning and experimentation, I was so dedicated to the project I would start working on it in the morning and not stop until the end of the day on some days. While a lot of the architecture was still rudimentary, I am quite happy with what I managed to create.</p>
							<p>The Game itself features a simple Player Controller, a Combat system with a Sword Attack and various enemies with different AI patterns. A Main Menu and Scene Transition is implemented, as well as a skeleton of the starting area and first dungeon. All the Game Design, Coding and Artwork were done by me, from scratch.</p>
